## FAQ

**Q: I don't know my timeline. What should I pick?**  
A: Pick 4 weeks. It's the most flexible and allows deep learning without overwhelming yourself.

**Q: Can I switch paths after starting?**  
A: Absolutely. All patterns and frameworks are independent. Jump between them freely.

**Q: What if I just want to code?**  
A: Go to [python/patterns/](python/patterns/), pick a topic, and run the tests. Learning happens by solving.

**Q: How much time should I spend on each problem?**  
A: Try solving for 15-20 minutes first. If stuck, check the test file to understand the expected behavior, then try again.
