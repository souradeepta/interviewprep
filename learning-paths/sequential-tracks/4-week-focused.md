## 📝 Tips for Success

1. **Code first:** Don't just read solutions — code every problem
2. **Test edge cases:** Always test with empty, single-element, and large inputs
3. **Time yourself:** Get comfortable solving under pressure
4. **Understand why:** Know why a solution works, not just how
5. **Track progress:** Mark problems complete as you go
