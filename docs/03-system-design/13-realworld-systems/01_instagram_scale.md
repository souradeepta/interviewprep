## Scenario

Instagram-Scale Photo Sharing is a critical component in modern distributed systems. In real-world applications, handling complex business logic at scale with high reliability. For example, major tech companies like Netflix, Uber, and Airbnb rely on similar solutions to handle millions of concurrent users and requests. The challenge is achieving this while maintaining sub-100ms latency, 99.99% availability, and gracefully handling 10x traffic spikes during peak demand. This component provides the foundational capability to solve these challenges reliably and efficiently at global scale.

## Users

## Flow

The typical operational flow for this system involves these key phases:

1. **Request Arrival**: Client/upstream system sends request with required parameters and context
2. **Validation & Routing**: System validates request format, authentication, and routes to correct handler/shard/instance
3. **Core Processing**: Execute the main algorithm, database query, or business logic on the data/state
4. **State Management**: Update internal state (caches, indexes, counters, logs) with proper atomicity and locking
5. **Response Generation**: Format results and return to requester with relevant metadata (timing, version info)
6. **Observability**: Record metrics (latency, throughput, errors), logs (for debugging), and traces (for performance analysis)

This flow repeats thousands or millions of times per second in production. Each operation's efficiency compounds across the entire system, making careful optimization essential. Bottlenecks at any phase can cascade to impact overall system performance.

## Back-of-Envelope Calculations

- 1B photos, 100KB avg: 100PB storage
- 1M users, 1000 photos each average
- Feed: cache 1000 latest per user = 1B entries × 100 bytes = 100GB

## Design Choice Comparison

## Common Questions & Answers

**Q: What is caching and why do we need it?**

A: Caching stores frequently accessed data in fast storage (memory) to reduce latency and load on slower backends (database). Trade space (cache) for speed (latency). Critical for systems serving millions of requests per second.

**Q: What are the main cache eviction policies?**

A: LRU (least recently used), LFU (least frequently used), FIFO (first in first out), TTL (time-based), Random, and ARC (adaptive replacement). Choose based on access patterns: LRU for temporal, LFU for frequency, TTL for time-sensitive data.

**Q: What is cache hit rate and cache miss rate?**

A: Hit rate = successful_finds / total_accesses. Miss rate = 1 - hit rate. P(hit) = hits / (hits + misses). Target 80%+ hit rates for effective caching. Too-small cache gives low hit rate (wasted resources). Too-large cache uses more memory than needed.

**Q: How do you handle cache invalidation when backend data changes?**

A: Use TTL (time-based expiration), active invalidation (notify cache on write), cache-aside pattern (client checks backend), or write-through (update both). Active invalidation is fastest but complex. TTL is simplest but has stale data window.

**Q: What is the cache-aside pattern?**

A: Application checks cache first. On miss, fetch from backend, update cache, then return. Simple to implement. Risk: race condition where multiple threads fetch same miss simultaneously (thundering herd problem).

**Q: What is write-through caching?**

A: Writes go to both cache and backend simultaneously (synchronously). Ensures consistency: read always gets latest. Cost: write latency includes backend write. Safer than write-back but slower.

**Q: What is write-back (write-behind) caching?**

A: Writes go to cache only; backend updated asynchronously later (batch or periodic). Fast writes. Risk: data loss if cache fails before flushing. Need durability guarantees (persistence, replication).

**Q: How do you choose cache size?**

A: Estimate working set (frequently accessed data volume). Add 20-30% buffer for margin. Monitor hit rate: if < 80%, increase size. If > 95%, might be oversized (waste). Use tools like cachegrind to profile.

**Q: What's the difference between client-side and server-side caching?**

A: Client cache (browser): reduces network round-trips, entirely controlled by client. Server cache (memory, Redis): shared across clients, controlled by server. Multi-level caching often best.

**Q: How do you measure cache effectiveness?**

A: Hit rate (primary metric), latency reduction (P99 latency with vs. without cache), backend load reduction, and memory cost per cache entry. Calculate ROI: cost of cache vs. benefit (reduced latency, backend load).

## Follow-up Questions & Answers

**Q: How do you prevent the thundering herd problem in caches?**

A: When popular key expires, many threads fetch from backend simultaneously causing spike. Solutions: probabilistic early expiration (refresh before TTL), request coalescing (single thread rebuilds, others wait), or bloom filters (detect non-existent keys fast).

**Q: How would you implement multi-level cache hierarchy?**

A: Use L1 (fast, small, in-process), L2 (medium, local machine), L3 (large, remote, Redis). Check L1, miss→L2, miss→L3, miss→backend. On write: update all levels. Trade space for speed across levels.

**Q: Can you implement read-through caching (automatic population)?**

A: Yes, cache loader/resolver called on miss. Transparent to application. Backend automatically uses cache layer. More complex than cache-aside but cleaner separation.

**Q: How do you handle hot keys in distributed caches?**

A: Hot key = key accessed by many threads/clients. Replicate hot keys on multiple cache nodes. Use local in-process caches for very hot keys. Monitor and detect hot keys automatically.

**Q: What's the difference between warm and cold cache startup?**

A: Cold cache: empty at start, misses until populated (slow ramp-up). Warm cache: pre-loaded from previous state (RDB/snapshot). Warm startup is critical for production (instant performance).

**Q: How would you measure cache effectiveness for business metrics?**

A: Track hit rate, P99 latency (with/without cache), backend QPS reduction, revenue impact. Calculate cache size vs. cost savings. A/B test to prove business value.

**Q: What happens when cache size is insufficient for working set?**

A: Constant evictions = high miss rate = ineffective cache. Solution: increase cache size, improve eviction policy, reduce working set, or use better hardware (faster storage).

**Q: How do you debug cache issues in production?**

A: Monitor hit rate continuously. Profile cache keys (which keys are accessed). Check for cache stampedes (sudden miss spike). Use distributed tracing to see cache path.

**Q: How would you implement a persistent cache?**

A: Combine memory cache (fast) with persistent backend (database, RocksDB, LevelDB). Write-back pattern: batch updates to persistent store. Trade latency for durability.

**Q: Can you use caching for write-heavy workloads?**

A: Write caching is risky (consistency issues). Use carefully: write-through for safety, write-back for speed. Good for batch writes (aggregate before writing). Monitor durability guarantees.



## Back-of-the-Envelope Calculations

**System Load Estimation:**
- 1M daily active users × 10 requests/day = 10M requests/day
- Peak QPS = 10M / 86400 × 3 (peak factor) ≈ 350 QPS
- API server capacity: 1000 QPS/server → 1 server sufficient at peak
- With 2x redundancy: 2 servers minimum

**Storage Estimation:**
- 1M users × 10KB average data = 10GB structured data
- Annual growth: 10GB × 365 = 3.65TB/year
- With 3x replication: 11TB/year
- SSD cost ($0.10/GB): $1,100/year

**Bandwidth:**
- 350 QPS × 10KB response = 3.5MB/sec outbound
- Monthly egress: 3.5MB × 86400 × 30 = 9TB/month
