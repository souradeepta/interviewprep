# DNS Resolution

## Problem Statement

Design the Domain Name System (DNS) — a distributed hierarchical system that translates human-readable domain names (e.g., `www.example.com`) into IP addresses.

**Requirements:**
- Fast lookups (< 10ms for cached, < 100ms for recursive)
- Highly available (no single point of failure)
- Globally distributed
- Support millions of domains and billions of queries/day

## Scenario

DNS Resolution is a critical component in modern distributed systems. In real-world applications, translating domain names to IP addresses globally. For example, major tech companies like Netflix, Uber, and Airbnb rely on similar solutions to handle millions of concurrent users and requests. The challenge is achieving this while maintaining sub-100ms latency, 99.99% availability, and gracefully handling 10x traffic spikes during peak demand. This component provides the foundational capability to solve these challenges reliably and efficiently at global scale.

## Users

- **Backend Engineers**: Responsible for implementing and maintaining this system component in production environments. They need to understand the architecture, trade-offs, failure modes, and operational considerations.
- **DevOps/SRE Teams**: Monitor system health, manage scaling policies, handle incidents, and ensure reliability SLAs are met. They need insights into performance characteristics, bottlenecks, and failure recovery mechanisms.
- **Data Engineers**: Design data pipelines and analytics around this system, requiring deep understanding of data flow, consistency guarantees, and throughput characteristics.
- **System Architects**: Make high-level architectural decisions that impact company infrastructure, requiring comprehensive understanding of capabilities, limitations, and scalability boundaries.
- **Security Teams**: Understand security implications, potential vulnerabilities, and compliance requirements for this component.

## PRD

### Functional Requirements
- Core operations work correctly
- Explicit error handling
- Consistency guarantees defined
- Monitoring and observability

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance targets met
- Availability SLA achieved
- Scalability headroom
- Cost efficient

### Success Metrics
- Benchmarks met
- Uptime targets met
- Resource budgets
- No data loss


## Flow

The typical operational flow for this system involves these key phases:

1. **Request Arrival**: Client/upstream system sends request with required parameters and context
2. **Validation & Routing**: System validates request format, authentication, and routes to correct handler/shard/instance
3. **Core Processing**: Execute the main algorithm, database query, or business logic on the data/state
4. **State Management**: Update internal state (caches, indexes, counters, logs) with proper atomicity and locking
5. **Response Generation**: Format results and return to requester with relevant metadata (timing, version info)
6. **Observability**: Record metrics (latency, throughput, errors), logs (for debugging), and traces (for performance analysis)

This flow repeats thousands or millions of times per second in production. Each operation's efficiency compounds across the entire system, making careful optimization essential. Bottlenecks at any phase can cascade to impact overall system performance.

    end
```

## Design

### DNS Record Types

```
A      → IPv4 address         (www.example.com → 1.2.3.4)
AAAA   → IPv6 address         (www.example.com → ::1)
CNAME  → Canonical alias      (blog.example.com → example.com)
MX     → Mail server          (example.com → mail.example.com)
TXT    → Text/verification    (SPF, DKIM records)
NS     → Name server          (who handles this domain)
SOA    → Zone authority info  (primary NS, serial, TTL)
```

### Caching Hierarchy

```
Browser cache (5-300s TTL)
  → OS cache (/etc/hosts, nscd)
    → Resolver cache (ISP/corporate)
      → Recursive resolver (Google 8.8.8.8, Cloudflare 1.1.1.1)
        → Root servers (13 clusters, anycast)
          → TLD servers (.com, .org, .net)
            → Authoritative servers (origin of truth)
```

### DNS Resolution Modes

| Mode | Description | RTT |
|------|-------------|-----|
| Recursive | Resolver does all the work | 1 RTT to client |
| Iterative | Client contacts each server | Multiple RTTs |
| Caching | Return cached answer | < 1ms |

## Back-of-Envelope Calculations

```
Google handles ~1 trillion DNS queries/day:
  1T / 86400s ≈ 11.6M queries/sec

Cache hit rate ~85%:
  Miss rate: 11.6M × 0.15 = 1.7M recursive lookups/sec

Average DNS response size: 100 bytes
Bandwidth: 11.6M × 100B = 1.16 GB/s

Root server queries (small % since resolvers cache TLD answers):
  ~1.7M × 0.001 = 1,700 root queries/sec per 13-cluster root

Recursive resolution latency:
  Root RTT: 20ms + TLD: 40ms + Auth: 30ms = ~90ms total
  Cached: <1ms
```

## Design Choices

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|---|---|---|
| Anycast routing | Geographically close server, DDoS resilience | Harder to debug routing |
| High TTL (3600s) | Less DNS traffic, faster | Slow propagation of changes |
| Low TTL (60s) | Fast failover | More DNS load |
| Round-robin DNS | Simple LB | No health checks, stale |
| GeoDNS | Route to nearest DC | Complex setup |

| Recursive resolve | O(depth) | Typically 3 hops |
| Zone transfer | O(n) | n = number of records |
| Space | O(n) | Cached records |

## Common Questions & Answers

**Q: What is caching and why do we need it?**

A: Caching stores frequently accessed data in fast storage (memory) to reduce latency and load on slower backends (database). Trade space (cache) for speed (latency). Critical for systems serving millions of requests per second.

**Q: What are the main cache eviction policies?**

A: LRU (least recently used), LFU (least frequently used), FIFO (first in first out), TTL (time-based), Random, and ARC (adaptive replacement). Choose based on access patterns: LRU for temporal, LFU for frequency, TTL for time-sensitive data.

**Q: What is cache hit rate and cache miss rate?**

A: Hit rate = successful_finds / total_accesses. Miss rate = 1 - hit rate. P(hit) = hits / (hits + misses). Target 80%+ hit rates for effective caching. Too-small cache gives low hit rate (wasted resources). Too-large cache uses more memory than needed.

**Q: How do you handle cache invalidation when backend data changes?**

A: Use TTL (time-based expiration), active invalidation (notify cache on write), cache-aside pattern (client checks backend), or write-through (update both). Active invalidation is fastest but complex. TTL is simplest but has stale data window.

**Q: What is the cache-aside pattern?**

A: Application checks cache first. On miss, fetch from backend, update cache, then return. Simple to implement. Risk: race condition where multiple threads fetch same miss simultaneously (thundering herd problem).

**Q: What is write-through caching?**

A: Writes go to both cache and backend simultaneously (synchronously). Ensures consistency: read always gets latest. Cost: write latency includes backend write. Safer than write-back but slower.

**Q: What is write-back (write-behind) caching?**

A: Writes go to cache only; backend updated asynchronously later (batch or periodic). Fast writes. Risk: data loss if cache fails before flushing. Need durability guarantees (persistence, replication).

**Q: How do you choose cache size?**

A: Estimate working set (frequently accessed data volume). Add 20-30% buffer for margin. Monitor hit rate: if < 80%, increase size. If > 95%, might be oversized (waste). Use tools like cachegrind to profile.

**Q: What's the difference between client-side and server-side caching?**

A: Client cache (browser): reduces network round-trips, entirely controlled by client. Server cache (memory, Redis): shared across clients, controlled by server. Multi-level caching often best.

**Q: How do you measure cache effectiveness?**

A: Hit rate (primary metric), latency reduction (P99 latency with vs. without cache), backend load reduction, and memory cost per cache entry. Calculate ROI: cost of cache vs. benefit (reduced latency, backend load).

## Follow-up Questions & Answers

**Q: How do you prevent the thundering herd problem in caches?**

A: When popular key expires, many threads fetch from backend simultaneously causing spike. Solutions: probabilistic early expiration (refresh before TTL), request coalescing (single thread rebuilds, others wait), or bloom filters (detect non-existent keys fast).

**Q: How would you implement multi-level cache hierarchy?**

A: Use L1 (fast, small, in-process), L2 (medium, local machine), L3 (large, remote, Redis). Check L1, miss→L2, miss→L3, miss→backend. On write: update all levels. Trade space for speed across levels.

**Q: Can you implement read-through caching (automatic population)?**

A: Yes, cache loader/resolver called on miss. Transparent to application. Backend automatically uses cache layer. More complex than cache-aside but cleaner separation.

**Q: How do you handle hot keys in distributed caches?**

A: Hot key = key accessed by many threads/clients. Replicate hot keys on multiple cache nodes. Use local in-process caches for very hot keys. Monitor and detect hot keys automatically.

**Q: What's the difference between warm and cold cache startup?**

A: Cold cache: empty at start, misses until populated (slow ramp-up). Warm cache: pre-loaded from previous state (RDB/snapshot). Warm startup is critical for production (instant performance).

**Q: How would you measure cache effectiveness for business metrics?**

A: Track hit rate, P99 latency (with/without cache), backend QPS reduction, revenue impact. Calculate cache size vs. cost savings. A/B test to prove business value.

**Q: What happens when cache size is insufficient for working set?**

A: Constant evictions = high miss rate = ineffective cache. Solution: increase cache size, improve eviction policy, reduce working set, or use better hardware (faster storage).

**Q: How do you debug cache issues in production?**

A: Monitor hit rate continuously. Profile cache keys (which keys are accessed). Check for cache stampedes (sudden miss spike). Use distributed tracing to see cache path.

**Q: How would you implement a persistent cache?**

A: Combine memory cache (fast) with persistent backend (database, RocksDB, LevelDB). Write-back pattern: batch updates to persistent store. Trade latency for durability.

**Q: Can you use caching for write-heavy workloads?**

A: Write caching is risky (consistency issues). Use carefully: write-through for safety, write-back for speed. Good for batch writes (aggregate before writing). Monitor durability guarantees.

### Traffic & Throughput
**Assumptions:**
- Daily active users: 100 million (100M)
- Requests per user per day: 50
- Peak hour traffic: 10% of daily (concentrated)
- Request distribution: 70% read, 30% write

**Calculations:**
```
Total daily requests = 100M users × 50 requests = 5 billion requests/day
Average RPS = 5B requests / 86400 seconds ≈ 57,870 RPS
Peak hour RPS = (5B / 86400) × (100 / 10) ≈ 578,700 RPS
Peak minute RPS = 578,700 / 60 ≈ 9,645 RPS

Read operations = 57,870 × 0.7 ≈ 40,509 RPS (average)
Write operations = 57,870 × 0.3 ≈ 17,361 RPS (average)
```

### Storage Requirements
**Assumptions:**
- Data per user: 1 KB (profile, settings)
- Data per transaction: 500 bytes
- Data retention: 3 years

**Calculations:**
```
User profile storage = 100M × 1 KB = 100 GB
Transaction data = 5B requests/day × 500 bytes × 365 × 3 = 2.74 PB
Total storage ≈ 2.75 PB
Replication factor: 3× → 8.25 PB raw storage

Backup storage (weekly snapshots): 8.25 PB × 52 weeks = 429 PB
```

### Network Bandwidth
**Assumptions:**
- Average request size: 2 KB
- Average response size: 5 KB
- Replication overhead: 2× (write to replicas)

**Calculations:**
```
Inbound bandwidth = 57,870 RPS × 2 KB = 115.74 MB/s
Outbound bandwidth = 57,870 RPS × 5 KB = 289.35 MB/s
Replication bandwidth = 17,361 RPS × 2 KB × 2 = 69.44 MB/s
Total peak bandwidth ≈ 474 MB/s ≈ 3.8 Tbps (peak hour)
```

### Compute Requirements
**Assumptions:**
- Processing time per request: 10 ms
- CPU efficiency: 1 core handles 50 RPS

**Calculations:**
```
CPUs needed for average traffic = 57,870 RPS / 50 = 1,158 cores
CPUs needed for peak traffic = 578,700 RPS / 50 = 11,574 cores
Overprovisioning factor: 1.5× → 17,361 cores total

Using 16 cores per server = 17,361 / 16 ≈ 1,085 servers
With 3:1 replication = 3,255 servers needed
Regional redundancy (3 regions) = 9,765 servers
```

### Latency Analysis (p99)
**Components:**
- Network latency: 5 ms
- Processing: 10 ms
- Storage access: 50 ms (disk), 1 ms (cache)
- Replication write: 20 ms

**Path Analysis:**
```
Cache hit path: 5 + 1 + 5 = 11 ms
Database read path: 5 + 10 + 50 + 5 = 70 ms
Write path: 5 + 10 + 20 + 5 = 40 ms
```

### Cost Estimation
**Monthly costs (approximate):**
```
Compute: 9,765 servers × $1,000/month = $9.765M
Storage: 8.25 PB × $10/GB/month = $82.5M
Bandwidth: 3.8 Tbps × $0.12/GB = $456M
Personnel: 100 engineers × $200K = $20M
Total: ~$568M/month
Cost per user: $5.68/month
```


## Interview Questions & Answers

### Q1: Design the System from Scratch

**Question:** Design a system that can handle 1 billion requests per day with sub-100ms latency.

**Answer Structure:**
1. **Clarify requirements**: DAU, request types, geographic distribution, consistency needs
2. **Back-of-envelope**: Calculate RPS (11.5K avg, 115K peak), storage, bandwidth
3. **High-level design**: Load balancing → services → cache → storage
4. **Deep dive**:
   - Horizontal scaling with sharding
   - Multi-region active-active with eventual consistency
   - Caching strategy (write-through for critical data)
   - Monitoring: metrics, logging, tracing
5. **Bottlenecks**: Identify and address each
6. **Trade-offs**: Consistency vs. availability, latency vs. cost

### Q2: Scaling Challenges

**Question:** You're growing from 10M to 1B users (100x). What breaks and how do you fix it?

**Answer:**
- **Database bottleneck**: Sharding by user ID, consistent hashing, shard rebalancing
- **Cache hit rate drops**: Larger working set, tiered caching (L1: local, L2: distributed)
- **Replication lag**: Write-through for consistency-critical data, eventual consistency elsewhere
- **Operational complexity**: Infrastructure-as-code, auto-scaling, chaos engineering
- **Cost**: Optimize resource utilization, use reserved instances, spot instances for batch

### Q3: Failure Scenarios

**Question:** Your primary database goes down. What happens? How do you recover?

**Answer:**
- **Detection**: Health check timeout (3-5 seconds)
- **Failover**: Automatic promotion of replica using Raft consensus
- **Impact**: Write requests fail for ~10 seconds, reads use replicas
- **Recovery**: Background sync of failed node, re-add to cluster
- **Lessons**: Circuit breakers prevent cascade, bulkhead limits blast radius

### Q4: Consistency Requirements

**Question:** Do you need strong or eventual consistency? Why?

**Answer:**
- **Strong consistency**: Critical for financial transactions, inventory, user auth
  - Implementation: Quorum writes, read-after-write
  - Cost: Higher latency (p99 100ms+), lower throughput

- **Eventual consistency**: Fine for user feeds, recommendations, analytics
  - Implementation: Async replication, read-repair
  - Benefit: Lower latency (p99 <10ms), higher throughput

- **Hybrid approach**: Consistency per operation type, not global

### Q5: Performance Optimization

**Question:** How would you reduce p99 latency from 100ms to 20ms?

**Answer:**
1. **Profile** (measure first): Identify bottleneck (storage, network, compute)
2. **Caching**: Multi-tier (L1 local, L2 distributed), bloom filters for misses
3. **Batching**: Group operations, reduce RPC overhead
4. **Connection pooling**: Reuse TCP connections, reduce handshake latency
5. **Async I/O**: Non-blocking operations, increase parallelism
6. **Database optimization**: Indexing, query optimization, read replicas
7. **Code optimization**: Reduce allocations, use faster algorithms
8. **Hardware**: SSD for storage, faster network interconnects

### Q6: Operational Concerns

**Question:** How do you deploy a new version with zero downtime?

**Answer:**
1. **Canary deployment**: Roll out to 1% of servers, monitor metrics
2. **Gradual rollout**: 1% → 10% → 50% → 100% as confidence increases
3. **Health checks**: Automated rollback if error rate exceeds threshold
4. **Database migration**: Schema changes with backward compatibility
5. **Feature flags**: Toggle features independently of deployment
6. **Monitoring**: Enhanced alerting during rollout, easy incident response


## Technology Stack Recommendations

| Layer | Technology | Why |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| Load Balancing | Nginx, HAProxy, AWS ALB | Distribute traffic, health checks |

## Lessons Learned

1. **Premature optimization kills projects**: Start simple, measure, then optimize
2. **Consistency is hard**: Eventually consistent systems are tricky to reason about
3. **Monitoring is non-negotiable**: You can't fix what you can't see
4. **Failure is not rare**: Plan for it, test it, automate recovery
5. **Cost grows with complexity**: Each component adds operational overhead
