# News Feed System

## Problem Statement
Design a social media news feed that generates personalized timelines for users based on their followers and following.

**Operations:**
- `post(user_id, content)` — Create new post
- `getFeed(user_id)` — Get personalized timeline
- `follow(user_id, target_id)` — Follow user
- `like(user_id, post_id)` — Like post

## Design

### Fanout Strategies

**Fanout-on-Write:**
```
Post created → Push to all followers' feeds immediately
Pros: Fast reads, simple implementation
Cons: Expensive for users with many followers
```

**Fanout-on-Read:**
```
Post created → Stored centrally
Get feed → Merge posts from all follows
Pros: Scalable for heavy posters
Cons: Slow reads, aggregation overhead
```

**Hybrid:**
```
Fanout-on-write for active users
Fanout-on-read for celebrities
```

### Data Structure

```
users: {user_id -> User}
posts: {post_id -> Post}
followers: {user_id -> Set[follower_ids]}
feeds: {user_id -> [post_ids]} (cache)
```

## Complexity

| Operation | Fanout-Write | Fanout-Read |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| post | O(n) where n=followers | O(1) |
| getFeed | O(k) where k=feed_size | O(n*k) |
| Space | O(users*posts) | O(posts) |
